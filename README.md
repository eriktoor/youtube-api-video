# youtube-api-video

Hey guys, thanks for watching my youtube video. 

Steps are 
1. Go to the Google Developers Console and create a project, request a Youtube API V3 API_KEY and an OAUTH2 key to get your client_secret.json
2. `git clone` this repo and `pip install` all dependencies
3. add in your tokens, put your video ID and run the code -- it should make you manually authorize the code the first time through and then to be able to run my code in the background you can use screen. 

# To Update Video Title and Description
Use the folder titled updateTitle 

# To Update Video Thumbnail 
Use the folder title updateThumbnail 
`Note that you will also need Pillow which you can install with pip to do this`
